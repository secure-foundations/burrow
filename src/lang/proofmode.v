This is a heavily stripped-down version of HeapLang's proofmode support. To make
any program proofs reasonable we do need to implement `wp_pure` and `wp_bind`,
and as a demo of the implementation we also implement `wp_load` in the
reflective style typical in the IPM. `wp_pure` is the basis for a number of
tactics like `wp_rec` and `wp_let` and such, while `wp_bind` is what powers
`wp_apply`.
